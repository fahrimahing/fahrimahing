 Hi, I’m @fahrimahing I'm usually called Fahri, I come from East Nusa Tenggara.
 I’m interested in using computers, and my goal is also to introduce technology in my remote area.
 I’m currently learning learning how to understand and operate computers and other hardware so that it is useful in my village.
 How to reach me If you want to contact me, you can save my cellphone number: 085281105645, my Instagram: @fahrimahinggggg_ and my Facebook: Fahri. And I also don't use 
 Twitter.
 Fun fact: I'm handsome, I don't like alcohol, and I don't like fruit.
